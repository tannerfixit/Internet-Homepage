# Internet-Homepage
A starter page for everything you might need when getting on the web
*Utilities 3.0*
(Third rendition of this project)

This project is a work in progress, stemming off from about a year ago when I first designed a similar homepage.
I've tried to find similar projects on the internet, and so far none have been remotely close to where mine is heading.
My homepage is based on three components:
  1. Widget View
  2. Quick Link View
  3. Settings View
  
I started this on October 14th, so keep in mind it's in very early development and many things are going to change in the near future.
